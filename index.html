          <span>You may have heard of me, and if you haven't, you're reading about me so joke's on you. I studied videography and media arts in college and have been all about UX and UI design ever since.<br /><br />When I started working in ecommerce, I quickly fell in love with the intersection of math and art. Analytics let me quantify the success of design choices in real dollars and cents, and there's no better high than a winning design. I fell in love with UI design at the same time I fell in love with Google Analytics and Google Opitimize. I love designing new ideas and digging into the numbers to see what worked (and learning from what didn't).<br /><br />I'm in love with ecommerce optimization and live for huge conversion rates. I'm also a monster at ping pong and I can play over 1 instrument.</span>
