          <span>If I've found a home in anything, it's CRO. I've been designing for over 10 years but never found a way to combine design with business best practices until exploring this realm.<br /><br />My technique is simple: I start with experience changes deep in the funnel, usually on the product detail page, such as the Add to Cart button, images, and product description. I'll usually then work funnel-out and optimize items on category pages, then work to the home page and navigation. I always find the more I experiment, the more I learn and the more ideas I get for tests with other brands; that's what excites me the most!<br /><br />In 2018, I generated over $300k in extra revenue from experimentation and learned a metric ton about a/b testing process and design.</span>

          <span>As I started to get more into ecommerce optimization, I realized that I needed to get deeper into the head of the user to understand what makes a seamless digital experience. I got my certification in User Experience Design last year and use those processes to build high-converting webpages that help the client or consumer get what they need as easily as possible.<br /><br />I constantly use:<br />-&nbsp;User interviews<br />-&nbsp;Cardsorting<br />-&nbsp;Lo-fi and hi-fi wireframing<br />-&nbsp;User-centered iteration<br />-&nbsp;Sketch, Illustrator, & InVision<br /><br /><a id="ux_button" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k-icjp7FhEJKQokjt6VQFmsLo762qjJi2myPyaxds7c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dating Project ></a></span>

          <span>User Interface Design was something I learned a lot about through experience and I finally got my certification late last year. My graphic design and ecommerce background helped fill in most of the blanks, but I've since sharpened my skills in color choice and typography that really guide the user's eye.<br /><br />I'm no professional at coding, but I did make this website from scratch! That's about the extent of my engineering knowledge; but I love prototyping and building wireframes in Adobe XD.<br /><br /><a id="ui_button" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-11DUMGuslQ9onDSPuCxWQA3cGWLAWWXMLYSCURrWOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Internal Company Education Site ></a></span>

          <span>I started making videos in high school for class projects, and by the end of school I had a YouTube channel and a couple of cameras. In college I transitioned to a Media Arts major after about half a semester and never looked back. I graduated with a degree in Media Arts with a strong focus on cinematography and directing.<br /><br />After college, I worked on a few sets and did some freelance work for the school before moving to Atlanta to be part of the film industry. I took a job in online retail in the meantime and immediately fell in love with web design and ecommerce. I've also done some extensive photography work for ecommerce products, lifestyle and studio shots.<br /><br /><a id="video_button" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/181100278">BigWood Boards Branding Video ></a><br /><a id="video_button" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu98mmVp104>">Short Film for the 2nd Act Film Festival ></a></span>

          <span>In late 2016 I took over the front-end operations for a brand called BigWood Boards. I handled all the site design, content, photography, product creation, and accounting. I also got my chops up on PPC, paid social advertising, and SEO.<br /><br />With my leadership, I'm proud to say the brand is now profitable and has grown 30% YoY each year. I increased cyber week sales 600% YoY in 2017 and 100% YoY in 2018.<br /><br />I'm now certified in Google Analytics, AdWords, front end web design, and I'm working on a Facebook Blueprint certification. I'd love to really see some more challenges in the advertising realm.</span>
