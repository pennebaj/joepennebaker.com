          <span>If I've found a home in anything, it's CRO. I've been designing for over 10 years but never found a way to combine design with business best practices until exploring this realm.<br /><br />My technique is simple: I start with experience changes deep in the funnel, usually on the product detail page, such as the Add to Cart button, images, and product description. I'll usually then work funnel-out and optimize items on category pages, then work to the home page and navigation. I always find the more I experiment, the more I learn and the more ideas I get for tests with other brands; that's what's most exciting to me!<br /><br />In 2018, I generated over $300k in extra revenue from experimentation and through that learned more about a/b testing process and design.</span>

          <span>As I started to get more into ecommerce optimization, I realized that I needed to get deeper into the head of the user to understand what makes a good digital experience. I got my certification in User Experience Design last year and use those processes to build high-converting webpages that really speak to the consumer.<br /><br />I constantly use:<br />-&nbsp;User interviews<br />-&nbsp;Cardsorting<br />-&nbsp;Lo-fi and hi-fi wireframing<br />-&nbsp;User-centered iteration<br />-&nbsp;Sketch, Illustrator, & InVision<br /><br />Here's a personal project I worked on, a dating app: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k-icjp7FhEJKQokjt6VQFmsLo762qjJi2myPyaxds7c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Take me there ></a></span>

          <span>User Interface Design was something I learned a lot about through experience, and I finally got my certification late last year. My graphic design and ecommerce experience helped fill in most of the blanks, but I sharpened my skills in color choice and typography that guide the user's eye.<br /><br />I'm no professional at coding, but I did make this website from scratch! That's about the extent of my engineering knowledge, but I love prototyping and building wireframes in Adobe XD.</span>

          <span>When I first opened Photoshop in middle school, inspiration struck as soon as I used the clone tool. I became obsessed and quickly got myself in trouble when I started adding mustaches to people's FB profile pictures (if they left their profile open on my laptop).<br /><br />Fast forward about eight years, and I finished up my minor in Graphic Design where I studied typography and got pretty darn good at Illustrator.<br /><br />As a professional, I've made infographics, logos, banners, and more for dozens of brands, and I love killing time making art in Illustrator.</span>

          <span>I started making videos in high school for class projects and by the end of school had a YouTube channel and a couple of cameras. In college I transitioned to a Media Arts major after about half a semester and never looked back. I graduated with a degree in Media Arts with a strong focus on cinematography and directing.<br /><br />After college, I worked on a few sets and did some freelance work for the school before moving to Atlanta to be part of the film industry. I took a job in online retail in the meantime and immediately fell in love with web design and ecommerce. I've also done some extensive photography work for ecommerce products, lifestyle and studio.<br /><br />Here's some freelance work I've done:<br /><a href="https://vimeo.com/181100278">-&nbsp;BigWood Boards ></a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/UxK2ASO_NLI?t=135>">-&nbsp;USC Music School ></a></span>

          <span>In late 2016, I took over the front-end operations for a brand called BigWood Boards. I handled all the site design, content, photography, product creation, and accounting. I also got my chops up on PPC, paid social advertising, and SEO.<br /><br />With my leadership, I'm proud to say the brand is now profitable and has grown 30% YoY. I increased cyber week sales 600% YoY in 2017 and 100% YoY in 2018.<br /><br />I'm now certified in Google Analytics, AdWords, front end web design, and I'm working on a Facebook Blueprint certification. I'd love to really see some more challenges in the advertising realm.</span>
